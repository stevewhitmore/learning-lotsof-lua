# Learning Lots of Lua

Woohoo! We're going to learn Lua, a super awesome scripting language used for video game development! It's often compared to another programming language called Python
which is easily one of my favorite languages. Like Python, Lua is simple and easy to learn/use.

## Resources

### Official Documentation

There's no better place to learn about something than from the creators themselves. We'll be using the official Lua documentation to create flashcards.

[See official Lua documentation](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)

### Roblox Style Guide

We're learning this to build a Roblox game so it would be best to follow their coding style guide. There's a lot of different ways code can be written in any programming
language. A style guide helps software developers follow consistent coding patterns which makes the code easier for others to read and debug.

For example:

- Should variable names be camelCase or snake_case?
- How should things be spaced?
- Should we use single quotes or double quotes?

### Roblox DevHub

Once we get the basics down we'll dive into the official Roblox DevHub aimed at helping players build their own games!
